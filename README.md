# ATM-Machine


This project is a simulation of an ATM (Automated Teller Machine) built using Java. It provides basic functionalities that allow users to perform banking operations such as checking their balance, depositing money, withdrawing money, and also to view the transaction history. The main goal of this project is to demonstrate object-oriented programming concepts and enhance understanding of Java programming.

 ## Features

 
**User Authentication:** Secure login system that authenticates users using a PIN.

**Balance Inquiry:** Allows users to check their account balance.

**Cash Deposit:** Users can deposit money into their account.

**Cash Withdrawal:** Enables users to withdraw money from their account.

**Transaction History:** Keeps a record of all transactions performed by the user.

**Error Handling:** Robust error handling and user input validation.


## Technologies Used


**Java:** Core programming language used for development.

**Object-Oriented Programming:** Implemented using classes and objects to model the ATM system.

**Collections Framework:** Utilized for storing and managing user and transaction data.
